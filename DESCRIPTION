Title: Querying Biodiversity Databases on USFWS Properties
Version: 0.1.0
Author: person("Adam", "Smith", email = "adam_d_smith@fws.gov", role = c("aut",

Maintainer: Adam D. Smith <adam_d_smith@fws.gov>
Description: Functions to query multiple biodiversity databases (e.g., GBIF, BISON, 
  iDigBio, VertNet, Berkeley Ecoengine, AntWeb) based on the current ownership or 
  approved acquisition boundary of US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) properties, including
  National Wildlife Refuges, Waterfowl Production Areas, National Fish Hatcheries, and 
  others. The output of these queries can then be exported to spreadsheets for expert review
  of species occurrence records. Review spreadsheets modified according to specific 
  guidelines can then be imported, updated, and exported to spreadsheets ready for 
  incorporation into the FWSpecies database 
  (https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/fwspecies/home-1). This package benefits immensely 
  from the outstanding work of the rOpenSci community (https://ropensci.org).
